Missing value imputation

Outlier treatment

Dummy variable creation for categorical variables

Test-train split of the data

Standardisation of the scales of continuous variables

After all of this was done, a logistic regression model was built in Python using the function GLM() under statsmodel library. This model contained all the variables, some of which had insignificant coefficients. Hence, some of these variables were removed first based on an automated approach, i.e. RFE and then a manual approach based on VIF and p-value.

 

Apart from this also calculated confusion matrix and accuracy and saw how accuracy was calculated for a logistic regression model.
